## INTRODUCTION 
This project is used for an intoduction to creating and deploying a java-based web app using AWS, especially their CI/CD tools.It's invisible to the end-user, but makes a big impact by automating the software release processes<br>


## Technologies
Here's what I'm using for this project:

- **Amazon EC2**: I'm developing my web app on Amazon EC2 virtual servers, so that software development and deployment happens entirely on the cloud.
- **VSCode**: For my IDE, I chose Visual Studio Code. It connects directly to my development EC2 instance, making it easy to edit code and manage files in the cloud.
- **GitHub**: All my web app code is stored and versioned in this GitHub repository.

- **COMING SOON** AWS CodeArtifact**: Once it's rolled out, CodeArtifact will store my artifacts and dependencies, which is great for high availability and speeding up my project's build process.

- **COMING SOON** AWS CodeBuild**: Once it's rolled out, CodeBuild will take over my build process. It'll compile the source code, run tests, and produce ready-to-deploy software packages automatically.

- **COMING SOON** AWS CodeDeploy**: Once it's rolled out, CodeDeploy will automate my deployment process across EC2 instances.

- **COMING SOON** AWS CodePipeline**: Once it's rolled out, CodePipeline will automate the entire process from GitHub to CodeDeploy, integrating build, test, and deployment steps into one efficient workflow.

Let's started!!

# Set-Up-Web-App-in-the-Cloud-Build-a-CI-CD-Pipeline-Series Part 1
We'll build from scratch a CI/CD pipeline that automates the build and deployment of a web app. This is a 100% hands-on challenge, so get ready to write documentation.


Part 1: You are here!<br>
Part 2: Connect a GitHub Repo with AWS<br>
Part 3: Store Dependencies in CodeArtifact<br>
Part 4: Package an App with CodeBuild<br>
Part 5: Deploy an App with CodeDeploy<br>
Part 6: Automate Your Infrastructure with CloudFormation<br>
Part 7: CI/CD with CodePipeline
